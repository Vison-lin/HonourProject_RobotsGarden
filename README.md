# HonourProject_RobotsGarden

This is a Computer Science Honours Project at University of Ottawa. The major purpose of this project is to develop a visualizer to observe oblivious robots moving patterns. In terms of the complexity of the problem and the originality of the project, there are two algorithms are analyzed and implemented: gathering algorithm and random algorithm. 

Also, different variables of oblivious robots, such as limited memory, restricted vision, and implicit communication, are measured during this project. Moving pattern is determined by pattern formation algorithm (PFA).



## Visualizer

## Observed Algorithms - Gathering Algo
In order to gather Algorithm, we initially put robots in a arbitrary distinct position, and finally robots will gather together into one point.

## Observed Algorithms - Random Algorithm
In order to random Algorithm, we initially put robots in a arbitrary distinct position, and finally robots will move toward a random position in its own vision.

## Observed Algorithms - Combination Algorithm
By Combining two differents Algorithm which are gather Algorithm and ranom Agorithm to get various result of a experiment.
