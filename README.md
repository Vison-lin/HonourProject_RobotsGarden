# HonourProject_RobotsGarden

This is a Computer Science Honours project at University of Ottawa.
The major goals of this project is to develop a visualizer to observe oblivious robots moving patterns. 


Variables of oblivious robots, such as limited memorty, restricted vision, and implicit communication, are measured during this project.
Moving pattern is determined by pattern formation algorithm (PFA).


## Visualizer

## Observed Algorithms - Gathering Algo
In order to gather Algorithm, we initially put robots in a arbitrary distinct position, and finally robots will gather together into one point.

## Observed Algorithms - Random Algorithm
In order to random Algorithm, we initially put robots in a arbitrary distinct position, and finally robots will move toward a random position in its own vision.
